            In this project, we explored the topic of geometric modeling by building Bezier curves, as well as Bezier surfaces, using de Casteljau's algorithm.
            We also manipulated triangle meshes from <i>.dae</i> files that were represented by the half-edge data structure by implementing edge flips,
            splits, and loop subdivision to increase the amount of triangles on a given mesh efficiently, and subsequently increasing a mesh's resolution and
            adding smoother features.

        <b>
            Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
        </b>
        <p>
            de Casteljau's algorithm works by recursively applying linear interpolation on two points on a control curve until we get one point that lies
            on the Bezier curve. Our initial interpolated points will lie on the control curve, but as we perform more iterations on the new lines created
            by the new interpolated points, we will eventually get a point that lies outside of the initial control curve and on the Bezier curve.
        </p>
        <p>
            We implemented de Castelejau's algorithm by defining a <i>lerp()</i> function and performing each step of the recursion one function call at a time.
            Each call to <i>evaluateStep()</i> would create an array <i>nextPoints</i> of <i>Vector2D</i> points, that would be of length \(n-1\), where \(n\) is the size of the input array.
            Each point added to <i>nextPoints</i> was the linear interpolation of two points from the input array. We repeat this until we have an array of length
            1, which represents the one point that lies on the Bezier curve.
        </p>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
        <b>
            Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
        </b>
        <p>
            When applying de Casteljau's algorithm to surfaces, we have to linearly interpolate points in 2 dimensions of the \(n \times n\) grid of control points.
            The Bezier surface is defined by the parameters \((u, v)\), which represent the parameters for the Bezier surface.
            First, we run de Casteljau's on one dimension of the control point grid to get a list of intermediate interpolated points, \(P_i\), in 1 dimension that lie
            on one dimension of the Bezier curve at parameter \(u\). We then take those intermediate points and run de Casteljau's again to get a final point \(P\) that lies on the Bezier surface at
            parameters \(u\) and \(v\).
        </p>
        <p>
            We defined three functions to implement this: <i>evaluateStep()</i>, <i>evaluate1D()</i>, and <i>evaluate()</i>. <i>evaluateStep()</i> behaves like the
            function we defined in part 1 where it performs 1 step of de Casteljau's, but updated to interpolate 3-D coordinates. <i>evaluate1D()</i> makes many calls to
            <i>evaluateStep()</i> such that we complete de Casteljau's algorithm for 1 dimension of control points. <i>evaluate()</i> takes in the \(n \times n\) grid
            of control points, makes calls to <i>evaluate1D</i>, and outputs a single control point \(P\) that lies on the Bezier surface.

        <b>
            Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
        </b>
        <p>
            We used the <i>getOppositeEdges()</i> method from Discussion 4 as a start to iterate around all the trianagles incident
            to a given vertex. For each triangle, we get the coordinates of each vertex, and generate two vectors originating from the
            center vertex. With these vectors, we calculate the norm of our current triangle. We then calculate the area of the triangle by taking the cross 
            product of the two vectors,
            add the product of this area and the norm to a running sum of "area-weighted-norms" for all triangles incident to the center vertex.
            Once we traverse all the triangles, we normalize the sum, and return it.

            We implemented the flip operation by first drawing out a diagram of how the new HalfEdges, Faces, Edges, and Verticies would change. First, we created
            Iter objects for every one of the HalfEdges, Faces, Edges, and Verticies of the triangle traversable by the flipped Edge e0. Then we
            translated the diagram by updating each of the respective pointers. We followed the reccomendation by updating all pointers even if they wouldn't change.

        <p>
            We intially had issues occur where flipping an edge would cause one of the bordering edges to disappear. The disappearing edge
            seemed to rotate around each outer edge as we kept flipping. This led us to believe a pointer was being incorrectly assigned. After carefully scrutinizing
            our code, it turns out that one of our pointers was initially incorrectly assigned, which fixed our issue. We also chose to rewrite this function because
            initially, we were overcomplicating the pointer reassignments by rotating all the half edges clockwise, rather than just reassigning new positions.
            While our code still remained the same length (since we still meticulously assigned every pointer), it potentially helped solve bugs that were
            arising in part 6.
        </p>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
        <b>
            Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
        </b>
        <p>
            We followed a similar approach to part 4, where we first drew out the diagram of how new components would be created and how exisiting components
            would be reassigned. Translating the diagram to code was relatively simple, we just carefully assigned every pointer to its new pointer after the
            edge split. We initially created 4 Faces to replace the two existing ones, and two new HalfEdges to replace h0 and h3. This meant that we had to
            delete unused elements, e0, h0, h3, f0, and f1. While this initially worked for independently testing this function, we encountered issues such as infinite
            loops or null pointer accesses when working on part 6. We decided to change the implementation so that we wouldn't have to delete any unused elements. We
            did this by just reassigning the old elements and creating a less objects. This helped fix the null pointer accesses and some of the infinite loops
            we encountered in part 6.

        <p>
            We had to debug this function twice: once when we were implementing it and another when we were implementing part 6. The first time, the program would
            crash after splitting an edge more than two or three times. It turns out we had an incorrect pointer assignment and forgot to assign some pointers,
            such as edges to halfedges. When implementing part 6, we came across null pointer accesses and infinite loops during the calls to <i>splitEdge()</i>, so
            we decided to rewrite our function such that we weren't deleting any elements. Although it took a while to realize <i>splitEdge()</i> was causing the issues,
            we were able to resolve some issues in part 6 with this fix.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
        <b>
            Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
        </b>
        <p>
            To implement loop subdivision, first, we iterate through every vertex, computing its new position as the sum of
            its neighboring verticies and its current position multiplied by some weights, storing it in its <i>new_position</i> attribute. To get the verticies,
            we iterated through each HalfEdge corresponding to the vertex. We also marked each vertex as belonging to the old mesh by setting the <i>is_new</i>
            flag to false. Then, we iterate through every edge, computing it's new "midpoint" position as the weighted sum of its vertex positions of the two bounding triangles.
            To get the verticies of the triangles, we iterated through the HalfEdges corresponding to the each Edge.

        </p>
        <p>
            After computing the new vertex positions, we split every edge that was part of the mesh by iterating over each edge and checking that it wasn't a boundary
            edge or a newly created split edge. We did this by getting the HalfEdges from the vertex outputted by <i>splitEdge()</i> and marking the newly created
            edges' <i>is_new</i> to <i>true</i> and marking the other two edges that was part of the original edge as <i>false</i>. We then assigned the newly created split vertex
            as new and updated its <i>new_position</i> to the one we computed from the edge midpoint.
        </p>

        <p>
            After splitting all the edges, we perform flips on any edge that connects an old and new vertex. We iterated through all the edges and checked if
            one of the new verticies was old and the other was new, and made sure it wasn't a boundary edge and that <i>is_new</i> is true. We then call
            <i>flip_edge()</i> on that edge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, we iterate through every vertex and update its position as long as it's not on a boundary. This resolves infinite lines drawn on boundaries in meshes
            like beetle.dae and maxplanck.dae.
        </p>
        <br />


        <b>
            Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
        </b>
        <p>
            It seems that corners verticies with an odd number of edges result in subdivisions that skew the resulting mesh in a way that creates an asymmetric
            region. For example, when subdividing the cube without any preprocessing, each of the corners portrude outwards compared to faces of the cube. This can be shown in
            the resulting images below.

        <p>
            If we preprocess the cube by performing some edge splits such that all corners have the same number of edges, we can create a more symmetrical
            render when we subdivide. However, just by performing edge splits, the cube will become rounder and won't maintain it's sharper features the more we subdivide.
            Because the preprocessing resulted in more edges on each corner compared to the faces of the cube, the corners will become rounder
            faster than the faces of the cube as we repeatedly subdivide. This leads to the rounder shape that we observe.

            Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.

        <p>
            If we preprocess the cubes by using a combination of edge splits and flips, we can create an initial mesh where the corners all still have an
            the same number of edges, but we also create more edges on each face. This will allow the corners to be evenly rounded while maintaining it's
            cube-like features. When performing subdivisions, this allows there to be more edges created on the faces as well as the corners, so the cube isn't as
            rounded than when just performing edge splits. We can see the result below.

            While we didn't implement subdividing on boundaries, we added a check so that we don't update verticies that lie on boundary points, this
            makes it so subdividing on meshes that contain boundaries won't have extraneous edges that go to infinity.
