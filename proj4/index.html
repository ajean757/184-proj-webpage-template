    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project, we built a physics simulator for a cloth. First, we constructed a grid of point masses and springs, which will be used to model our cloth. Then, we wrote the simulation for the cloth. At each timestep, we apply external forces to the cloth, then calculate changes in positions using Verlet Integration, and then constrained the positions so they wouldn't stretch past a defined threshold. We also implemented collisions with other objects such as a sphere or plane, as well as self collisions such that the cloth can fall on top of itself like a real cloth. Finally, we added shaders to create different effects on our cloths and scene objects.

        Describe the effects of changing the spring constant <code>ks</code>; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low <code>ks</code>?
        A high <code>ks</code>?
      </small>
    </b>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    With a very low ks, we used ks = 1, the cloth has a sort
    of whiplash effect when swinging, flowing into itself
    as a towel would in the wind. With a very high ks of 9000,
    the cloth seems very reactive to itself. As soon as the cloth
    begins to fall, it appears as if the first creases of the cloth
    near the pinned points pull the entirety of the cloth, causing
    it to shoot back and forth as if someone were waving a flag very
    vigorously.
  </p>


  <blockquote>
    <b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>density</code>?
      </small>
    </b>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    A low density of 1 makes the sheet very flowy. Ripples flow across
    the entirety of the fabric as it gently falls and swings with itself.
    A high density of 100 makes the sheet appear very heavy. It
    immediately falls down, and the springs cause the sheet to bounce
    and swing about the pinned points sporadically.
  </p>


  <blockquote>
    <b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>damping</code>?
      </small>
    </b>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Damping has a subtle effect. A damping of 0 essentially lets the
    cloth flow back and forth indefinitely, as if it were in a vacuum.
    A damping of 1 softens the swinging of the sheet, making it come to
    a rest quickly.
  </p>


  <blockquote>

  <p>
    We can see from these images that the spring constant changes the "stiffness" of the cloth. With a low spring constant, the cloth stretches more, and we can see more ripples in the cloth near the top. When we have a large spring constant, the cloth doesn't stretch as much and retains its original shape.
  </p>

      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>
    As we increase the density, the cloth gets heavier. When the density is 1, the cloth is very light, so the effects of gravity don't pull it down as much. When we increase the density, we can see the effects of gravity stretching the cloth, such as the bottoms tapering out on each side.

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>
    As we increase damping, we increase how "wavy" the cloth moves. When damping is 0, the cloth ripples and sways back and forth a lot, it has a greater range of motion as it oscillates. Furthermore, because damping affects the forces applied to the point masses by diminishing them over time, 0 damping causes the cloth to continue moving. When we increase damping to 0.758, the cloth falls down gently, maintaining a uniform shape as it falls to rest.

  <p>
    When we have a low spring constant, the cloth wraps more tightly around the sphere, and we can see how the sphere bulges the cloth. At the default spring constant, we can see the cloth doesn't bend and wrap around the sphere as much as the low spring constant. With a high spring constant, the cloth is stiffer and doesn't comform to the sphere shape as much, so we can see the outline of the sphere doesn't appear as prominently as the other images.

  <p>
    As we've noticed earlier, density affects the weight of the cloth. So a lower density would mean the cloth isn't affected as strongly by gravity. The cloth with a density of 1 falls slowly compared to the default density value, as a result it doesn't fall on itself as much and spreads out more evenly over the plane. We can also notice the folds in the first image are fewer and longer.
  </p>

  <p>
    As we increase the density, the cloth becomes heavier, which makes it fall faster. We can see a lot more folds in the first image compared to when the density=1. Furthermore, once the cloth is at rest on the plane, it's less spread out.

    Changing the spring constant affects the stretchiness of the cloth. With a low spring constant, we can see that when the cloth folds on top of itself, it's more deformed and the folds are tighter.

  <p>
    With a high spring constant, the cloth becomes stiffer. So when it folds it will tend to fold more symmetrically and be less prone small displacements in its structure. We observe this in the first image, where the cloth folds into many layers on top of itself. In the second image, we can still see a lot of structure in the folding when it gets closer to a resting position.

    <b>
      Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Because it's computationally expensive to run real time lighting operations on the CPU alongside other simulation logic, we need a faster way to render lighting effects. This is where shaders come in: shaders are programs separate from the main program that runs parallel on the GPU. There are two types of shaders, vertex shaders and fragment shaders. Like the name implies, vertex shaders apply transformations to verticies; we use them to output vectors with a change of basis applied to them or translations due to textures in displacement mapping. On the other hand, fragment shaders are responsible for processing shaders per fragment (a fragment can be analogous to a pixel), in which we take some vector inputs and perform some calculations to output a color vector.
  </p>

    </b>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The Blinn-Phong shading model is able to approximate the specular light reflecting off of an object. We do this calculating a vector which is the bisection of the viewing direction and lighting direction. We then use the Blinn-Phong model equation $L_s = k_s (I/r^2) \max{(0, n \cdot h)}^p$ to model the specular light at a point on the object. We also add the ambient light, which is $L_a = k_a I_a$, and the diffuse light, which is $L_d = k_d (I/r^2)\max{(0, n \cdot l )}$. Adding these three components together, we get the equation for total light emmited at a pixel as $L = k_a I_a + k_d (I/r^2)\max{(0, n \cdot l )} + k_s (I/r^2) \max{(0, n \cdot h)}^p$.
  </p>
  <p>
    The parameters we used were $k_s = 0.5$, $I_a = <1.0, 1.0, 1.0>$, $k_a = 0.1$, $k_d = \text{u_color}$

      Use the same texture for both renders.
      You can either provide your own texture or use one of the ones in the textures directory,
      BUT choose one that's not the default <code>texture_2.png</code>.
      Compare the two approaches and resulting renders in your own words.
      Compare how your the two shaders react to the sphere by changing the sphere mesh's coarseness by using <code>-o 16 -a 16</code> and then <code>-o 128 -a 128</code>.

    In Bump Mapping, we apply transformations to the normal vectors such that when the fragment shader applies color, we get an illusion of detail on the object. This can create affects like varying heights or bumps on a texture. First, we need to compute the tangent-bitangent-normal (TBN) matrix, which can be used to transform a vector in object space to world space. In order to compute the displaced normal, we need to compute how the "height" of an image changes with small changes to u or v. We use the equations $dU = (h(u + 1/w, v) - h(u, v)) * k_h * k_n$ and $dV = ((h(u, v+1/h) - h(u, v)) * k_h * k_n$, where $k_h$ and $k_n$ are the height scaling and normal scaling factors, respectively. $h(u, v)$ returns the height encoded by the texture map, in our case we use the $r$ component of the color vector. Our new normal vector is $\vec{n_o} = (-dU, -dV, 1.0)$, and we can transform it to world space normal by multiplying it by the TBN matrix, $\vec{n_d} = TBN \vec{n_o}$. We will use $\vec{n_d}$ for lighting computations involving the normal vector.

    In Displacement Mapping, we modify the vertex shader by displacing the vertex position towards the direction of the model space vertex normal. We perform the following operation and return the vector $\vec{p'}$ when outputting the position to <i>gl_position</i>: $\vec{p'}  = \vec{p} + \vec{n} * h(u, v) * k_h$
